Project behavioral analysis in Kaggle Speed_dating dataset



Speed_Dating
In 2002-2004, there was data collected for 21 different speed-dating outings with different individuals. Data was collected about each persons’s income, religious background, career, favorite hobbies, race, and ratings on how each individual believes they are perceived by others.

After each speed-dating outing, each individual was asked whether they wanted to match with the individuals they met. Additionally, they were asked to rate the people they met on a variety of traits (ambitious, attractive, sincere, fun, intelligent, etc.). In this analysis, we explored and assesed the factors that most significantly influence a person’s decision to “match” with others.


In conclusion, we see there are many factors which influence women’s and men’s decisions on saying “yes” to another date. For men, there seem to be more importance on the women being attractive and fun. However, for women’s taste in men, it seems that women prefer someone who is a balance of ambitious, intelligent, and fun. However, for the women who gave low and high ratings, the factor of attractiveness and being fun was crucial in the outcome of the ranking. Additionally, there didn’t seem to be much variance between the careers of men who were given a “no” and “yes” on the matching. Furthermore, the differences between the men who received a “0/1” and those who received a “9/10” were not significant except a few differences on the importance of “attractiveness” and “being fun”.
